TLC5940 Servo Driver
===

TLC5940 is intended to be a LED driver [Data sheet](www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlc5940.pdf), in order to 
control servos a pullup resistor (2.2K) must be added to each PWM output - see the schematic of Sparkfuns 
[breakout board](www.sparkfun.com/products/10616) or the following [page](http://letsmakerobots.com/node/35677)
to see example circuits.
