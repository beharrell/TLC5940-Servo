Spark Core TLC5940 Servo Driver
===

The TLC5940 is intended to be a LED driver - see [(Data sheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlc5940.pdf). 
In order to control servos, a pullup resistor (2.2K) must be added to each PWM output - see the schematic of 
Sparkfuns [breakout board](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10616) or the following 
[page](http://letsmakerobots.com/node/35677) for an example circuit.
